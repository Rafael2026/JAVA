## Insert a number and check if it is a happy number or no
It's the addition of digit (insert the number) squared

If result is one -> the number entered is a happy number

If the result is bigger than 10 or equal
  We repeat the same procedure (Line 1) with the result
  If the same procedure (repeated) never returns 1, but it returns a value which it is bigger than 0 and smaller than 10
    The last result will be 0 and the number won't be a happy number
